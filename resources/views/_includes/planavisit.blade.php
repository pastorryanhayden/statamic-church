      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Our foundation sits squarely on the Bible. While it may sound a bit old fashioned, we have found that the truths of God’s Word are timeless and they work in every generation. When you visit us, you will find others who love God and love people. We are more concerned with your heart than what you are wearing, so feel free to dress as you like. God does not look at the outward appearance, but the heart.
</p>
<p>Visiting a new church can be intimidating, but no worries. We have greeters at the front door to greet and answer any questions you might have. After opening announcements we have a Meet and Greet time in which people move about the church to mingle. People will seek you out. We want to get to know you! We have dynamic ministries tailored for growth in Christ for all ages. It is our desire as you worship with us, you grow as a follower of Jesus.
</p>

      <h2>Youth at First Christian</h2>
      <h3>Junior Church</h3>
      <p>We are very excited to have our kid’s ministry (K-5th grade) on Sunday mornings at the 10 am service during the sermon time. They will have games, a lesson and friends! We love the idea of teaching your kids about the love of Christ early in life and are excited that this ministry is going to do that in a powerful way. Bring your kids and be ready to hear some awesome bible stories from them!</p>
      <h3>Frog N Rock!</h3>
        <p>We meet on Sunday Afternoons from 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm for grades 6th thru 12th. We have fun games including the ever popular Zorb Ball and Gaga Ball! Music events, feeding the homeless, summer conferences and mission trips, and more. FROG N ROCK meets during the school year.</p>
