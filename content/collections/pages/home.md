When you visit us, you will find others who love God and love people. We are more concerned with your heart than what you are wearing, so feel free to dress as you like. God does not look at the outward appearance, but the heart.'

After opening announcements we have a Meet and Greet time in which people move about the church to mingle. People will seek you out. We want to get to know you! We have dynamic ministries tailored for growth in Christ for all ages. It is our desire as you worship with us, you grow as a follower of Jesus.'
